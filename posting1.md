I have a classmates mailing list where I occasionally post some resumes (as attached Word/pdf files), among other not related messages.The mailing list in newsletter style, powered by GNU Mailman.

I want to do the following:
- keep a repository of resume files and supporting information
- send out a listing of recent resumes to subscribers or redirect subscribers to a webpage with such listing.

My motivation is that listing of resumes 'in active search' will help people find more jobs.

I wrote some user scenarios and a draft for design (building blocks).

I'm looking for freelancer to do the following:

1.  indicate weak point/ambiguitites in user scenarios (0.5-1h)
2.   make your design in section 2 based on text written (1-1.5h) with focus on:

  - list and describe building blocks and functionalities
  - advice/options for implementation by block (like file storage: S3, Mongo)
  - how would you test each block
  - what templates (eg in cookiecutter) are avialable for these blocks

I'm liteky to recieve many garbage messages like "a talented developper will build a site for you on PHP in minutes", but I'm looking for someone to maintain meaningful conversation about the projects interms of user requirement, design specification, testing approach etc.
